Creating infinitely evolving space visuals in python + opengl.
Someday might turn this to screensaver / background image.

Some ideas:
1) Slowly shifting nebula clouds
2) Far away small blinking stars
3) Closer larger stars
4) Closer larger planets
5) Different types of galaxies (spiral / elliptical / irregular)
6) Starfields
7) Black hole that distorts surroundings.


Found really nice glsl noise / math library:
https://github.com/patriciogonzalezvivo/lygia/tree/main

Copied few glsl noise implementations from there and created custom parser to preprocess the includes.
